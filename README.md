# Topics in Big Data


## Introduction

The goal of this class is to cover topics in Big Data. The focus will be on principles and practices of big data processing and analytics. Data storage databases and data modeling techniques, data processing and querying, data analytics and applications of machine learning using these systems. We will learn about application of these concepts on large scale urban analytics in cities. 

## Instructor

Abhishek Dubey `(first name . last name at vanderbilt.edu)`

My research focus is on application of big data and machine learning for creating large scale social cyber-physical systems such as transportation networks. For more details visit my group project page. https://scope-lab-vu.github.io/

**Contact** We will use brightspace and piazza for communication. You can also create issues on github to point to any specific problem with an example or assignment. 

**Office Hours** Office Hours will be available on Friday at 1 PM to 2 PM at my office in Institute for Software Integrated Systems. http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/contact

I am also available by appointment as required. Send me an email if you need to meet with me outside the office hours.

 ## Exams, Quizzes, Assignments and projects
 
- 4 take home quizzes.
- 4 pop quizzes. They are primarily used to judge class participation. Unless there is a good reason (it is important to inform me beforehand) there will be no makeup. 
- 5 programming assignments. 
- There will be a mid-term exam on 2/26/2020
- The final exam will be replaced by a final project and summary report to be presented and submitted by the end of the day of the final class.  

## No collaborations unless explicitly permitted.

The Vanderbilt Honor Code will govern work done. ANY VIOLATIONS WILL RESULT in the case to be reported to the honor council. You are welcome to refer to the online sources for your assignments. However, you must not copy the code and must provide citation of the source of inspiration if do refer to the online sites. All work will be submitted via github.

## Evaluation

The following grading criteria are tentative and are
subject to change. Each graded item in this course will be assigned a
certain number of points. Your final grade will be computed as the total
number of points you achieved divided by the number of points possible.
The instructor reserves the right to apply a curve to the final result.


## Grading Criteria

| Category        | Percentage  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Programming Assignments    | 30% | 
| Class Pop Quizzes    | 10% | 
| Take Home Quizzes          | 20% |
| Mid Term Exam | 20%|
| Final Project              | 20% |


## Course Policies

Submissions will be due by midnight on the day mentioned in the assignment and homework description. Late submissions will be penalized with an automatic **20 percent penalty per day** (applied relative to the graded score for the submission).

## Disability Statement

Vanderbilt is committed to equal opportunity
for students with disabilities. If you have a physical or learning
disability, you should ask the Opportunity Development Center to assist
you in identifying yourself to your instructors as having a disability,
so that appropriate accommodation may be provided. Without notification,
your instructors assume that you have no disabilities or seek no
accommodation.

## Emergency Evacuation Plan

 In the event of a fire or other emergency,
the occupants of this class should collect their coats and personal
belongings and leave the building using the stairs. VANDERBILT
UNIVERSITY POLICY FORBIDS REENTRY TO A BUILDING IN WHICH AN ALARM HAS
OCCURRED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION BY VANDERBILT SECURITY. If, in
consequence of a disability, you anticipate the need for assistance,
please discuss that need with the instructors.

If a tornado siren is heard, please go to the nearest interior hallway or interior rooms away from windows.
